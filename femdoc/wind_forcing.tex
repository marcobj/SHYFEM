The wind and the mean sea level pressure can be prescribed by means of
an external file, with extension |fem|, which can be both formatted
and unformatted. Please see the section on file formats to write such a
file correctly.  The name of the file must be specified in the |str|
file in the section |name|, using the flag |wind|. For example:

\begin{code}
$name
...
wind = 'mywind.fem'
...
$end
\end{code}

Other important parameters to set in the |str| file, in the section
|para|, are |iwtype| and |itdrag|. The former specifies the wind stress
formulation, while the latter is used to prescribe a constant value of
the wind drag coefficient.

For more information see the appendix.
