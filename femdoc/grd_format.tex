=============================================================

legend :

n	item number (node, element, line)
t	type
d	depth
x,y	coordinates
ntot	number of following nodes
n1,n2	node numbers

=============================================================

format of lines in input file :

comment:

0 [anything]

node:

1	n	t	x	y	[d]

element:

2	n	t	ntot	n1 n2 n3 ... 	[d]

line:

3	n	t	ntot	n1 n2 ...	[d]

=============================================================

comment :

lines may be split at any point, except befor optional argument
d must not be on seperate line
if line is split, the continuation line(s) must start with a blank
blank lines can be inserted as needed
if d is not specified -999. will be used (flag)
use t=0 if you do not know what to use
n must be unique for every item type 
item numbers need not be consecutive
the sequence of items is not important, 
nodes can be mixed with elements/lines
the minimum number of nodes for element items is 3
the minimum number of nodes for line items is 2
element items should have all nodes unique
line items with the same first and last node are considered closed

=============================================================
