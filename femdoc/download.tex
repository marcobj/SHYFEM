The source code of the model is provided in a file named \ttt{\shydist}
or similar, depending on the version of the code. In this case the
version is \version.  The file can be downloaded from the SHYFEM GIT
repository\footnote{https://github.com/SHYFEM-model/shyfem}, where
it is possible to choose the desired version and where the latest
\textit{develop} version is available.  Otherwise the code is available
also in the SHYFEM web-site\footnote{http://www.ismar.cnr.it/shyfem/}.

Once you have downloaded the model distribution, move the file to
the directory in which you want to install the model and unpack the
distribution. In the following we will assume that the file is in your
home directory and your home directory is called \ttt{\basedir}. However,
any other directory works as well. To unpack the distribution
in your home directory, move there and run the command:

\begin{codem}
    cd \basedir
    tar xzvf \shydist
\end{codem}

At this point a new folder named \ttt{\shydir} has been created. 
This directory is the root of the SHYFEM model. All other commands
given in this chapter assume that you are in this directory. 
Therefore, before reading on, please move into this directory:

\begin{codem}
    cd \shydir
\end{codem}
