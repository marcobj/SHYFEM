\section{Parameter list for the SHYFEM model}


\subsection{Section {\tt \$title}}

This section must be always the first section in the parameter input file.
It contains only three lines. An example is given in 
figure \ref{fig:titleexample}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{verbatim}
$title
        free one line description of simulation
        name_of_simulation
        name_of_basin
$end
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Example of section {\tt \$title}}
\label{fig:titleexample}
\end{figure}

The first line of this section is a free one line description of
the simulation that is to be carried out. The next line contains
the name of the simulation.
All created files will use this name in the main part of the file name
with different extensions. Therefore the hydrodynamic output file
(extension |out|) will be named |name_of_simulation.out|.
The last line gives the name of the basin file to be used. This
is the pre-processed file of the basin with extension |bas|.
In our example the basin file |name_of_basin.bas| is used.

The directory where this files are read from or written to depends
on the settings in section {\tt \$name}. Using the default
the program will read from and write to the current directory.

\subsection{Section {\tt \$para}}
\input{S_para_h.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$proj}}
\input{P_proj.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$waves}}
\input{P_waves.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$sedtr}}
\input{P_sediment.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$wrt}}
\input{P_wrt.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$lagrg}}
\input{P_lagrg.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$name}}
\input{S_name.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$bound}}
\input{S_bound.tex}

\subsection{Section {\tt \$wind}}
\input{S_wind.tex}


\subsection{Section {\tt \$extra}}

In this section the node numbers of so called ``extra'' points are given. 
These are points where the value of simulated variables (water level, 
velocities, temperature, salinity, tracer, etc.) are written to create
a time series that can be elaborated later. The output for these ``extra''
points consumes little memory and can be therefore written with a
much higher frequency (typically the same as the integration time step)
than the complete hydrodynamic output. The output is written
to file EXT.

The format of the section is the following:
\begin{verbatim}
$extra
	node1   'string1'
	node2   'string2'
	etc..
$end
\end{verbatim}
where node is the node number and string is a description of the node.
If no description strings are needed the nodes can also be specified
by just giving their values:
\begin{verbatim}
$extra
	node1  node2  node3
	node4  etc..
$end
\end{verbatim}
This format is however deprecated.


\subsection{Section {\tt \$flux}}

In this section transects are specified through which the discharge
of water is computed by the program and written to file FLX.
The transects are defined by their nodes through which they run.
All nodes in one transect must be adjacent, i.e., they must form a
continuous line in the FEM network.

The nodes of the transects are specified in free format and are
ended with the description of the section.
An example is given here:
\begin{verbatim}
$flux
	1001 1002 1004 'section 1'
	35 37 46 'special section'
	407
	301 'section given on two lines'
$end
\end{verbatim}
The example shows the definition of 3 transects. As can be seen, the 
nodes of the transects can be given on one line alone (first transect),
or on more than one lines (transect 3).
There is also an old format that seperates one section from the other by
inserting the value 0. However, this format is deprecated.


\section{Parameter list for the post processing routines}

The format of the parameter input file is the same as the one for
the main routine. Please see this section for more information
on the format of the parameter input file.

Some sections of the parameter input file are identical to the 
sections used in the main routine. For easier reference we will
repeat the possible parameters of these section here.


\subsection{Section {\tt \$title}}

This section must be always the first section in the parameter input file.
It contains only three lines. An example has been given already in 
figure \ref{fig:titleexample}.

The only difference with respect to the {\tt \$para} section of the main
routine is the first line. Here any description of the output can be used.
It is just a way to label the parameter file.  The other two line with
the name of simulation and the basin are used to open the files needed
for plotting.
