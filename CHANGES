between 7.0.0 and 7.0.1

	new meteo routines
	interpolation of wind will be different if wind is speed/dir
		in 7.0.0 wind is converted to u/v, then it is interpolated
		in 7.0.1 wind is directly interpolated with s/d
		results are different
	wind file time series also allows for pressure as 3rd column

7.5.5

	pressure is checked for reasonable values
	pressure gradient is computed in double precision (bug Donata)
	no time computation if file cannot be read (bug Petras)
