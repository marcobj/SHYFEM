Directory structure
===================

.		Main code and utilities
EvKF		Original Evenseen's code used for the analysis and
		for generating perturbations.


How it works
===================
Data assimilation (DA) use observations to improve the model results.
The final state, called "analysis" minimises the errors of the model
state, called "background", considering the observations with their
errors.
The period with observations is defined as "assimilation window".
This program needs an ensemble of restart files at the begin of the
assimilation window (first observation). 
A good idea is also to keep each member of the ensemble separated using
different forcings and/or boundary conditions.
The spread of the forcing and of the boundary condition should represent
their errors. 
To create an ensemble of forcing and/or BC consider the programs:
make_ens_meteo.F90 and make_eof_meteo.F90


Before running the code
===================

In order to run the enKF.sh script you need a program named parallel 
and the libraries: liblapack-dev, libfftw3-dev. You should find them 
in your Linux distribution.

Installation with a Debian OS from root:
apt-get update && apt-get install parallel liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev

Several options of the DA can be changed in mod_para.F90.

You need to make the following files:

- assconf.dat
- ens_list.txt
- antime_list.txt
- obs_list.txt
- nrens restart files
- nrens skel files
- nrobs observation files
- nrobs observation info files


Running the code
===================

In order to run the DA execute:

./enKF.sh [n. of threads]

At the end of this process you can run the Kalman Smoother analysis
with (no with local analysis at the moment):

./enKF2enKS [nrens] [output]


Some files must be prepared before running enKF.sh:

----------
assconf.dat
----------
This file must contain the following information in different lines:
- Name of the bas-file with the bas extension;
- Dimension of the model state (nkn nel nlv);
- Time step for the restart files (remember rst files can be converted into shy
  files). Use -1 to set the minimum number of steps or use a value in seconds.
  However, you must have a restart record at every analysis times, so if you are in
  doubt use -1;
- Initial ensemble: 0 for an ensemble loaded from files (suggested), 1 to
  create an ensemble from a state (to be tested - just z level is perturbed).
  With 1 make also a file named "init_ens.info", as described below;

----------
ens_list.txt
----------
This is a list of skel and rst files of the ensemble. Starting from member 0,
each row must contain the name of a skel and a rst files, separated by space.
The ensemble size is the number of rows of this file.

----------
antime_list.txt
----------
A list of the times, in string format, of the analysis steps. It is advisable to have analysis steps
at least of one hour. At least an observation must be present at each step.
String format has the same convention used in SHYFEM model (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD::HH:MM:SS)

----------
obs_list.txt
----------
A list of files containing in each line:
- a flag of the type of observation;
- the name of the file.

Possible flag for the observations are:
- 0DLEV : sea level timeseries;
- 0DTEM : surface temperature timeseries;
- 0DSAL : surface salinity timeseries;
- 2DVEL : FEM-file with 2D surface current fields (e.g., HFR radar).

The structure of the observation files is described below.

----------
init_ens.info (optional)
----------

Set the initial ensemble to 1 in the configuration file.
This file sets the white noise parameters to make an initial ensemble of
states. Only the sea level is perturbed.

init_ens.info must contain a row with:
  - nx ny fmult theta sigma

  where:
  - nx,ny are the dimension of the grid of the pseudo random fields
  - fmult is the mult factor to create a supersample from the initial ensemble
  - theta is the rotation of the pseudo random fields (0 East, anticlockwise)
  - sigma is the standard deviation of the water level

----------
mod_err.info (optional)
----------

Set mode_an = 1 in mod_para.F90 to activate the model errors.
This file is used to set the red noise parameters to propagate the model error,
by using an augmented state.
Warning!!! The routine make_2Dpert gives a segmentation fault.

mod_err.info must contain a row with:

  - nx ny fmult theta rerror dt tau

  where:
  - nx,ny are the dimension of the grid of the pseudo random fields
  - fmult is the mult factor to create a supersample from the initial ensemble
  - theta is the rotation of the pseudo random fields (0 East, anticlockwise)
  - rerror is the error relative to each value of the model variables. Use a
    small one. At the moment just the water levels have errors.
  - dt is the time between two observation steps (assumes regular intervals)
  - tau is the e-folding time of the red noise in the model error

----------
skel files
----------
These are the files to make the str files of the ensemble members during the
assimilation. If you made a previous ensemble you can use those str files to
create these. 
It's extremely important that you set the following strings in the skel files:

- Section title:
  NAMESIM

- Section para: 
  itanf = 'ITANF'
  itend = 'ITEND'
  itrst = 'ITANF'
  idtrst = IDTRST	(no quotation marks)

- Section name:
  restrt = 'RESTRT'

If you want to save the results during the analysis add:

- Section para:
  itrst = 'ITANF'
  itout = 'ITANF'
  itext = 'ITANF'
  itcon = 'ITANF'
  itmflx = 'ITANF'

All the other parameters can be set as you like.

----------
Initial restart files
----------
They must have one record at the time of the first analysis step. The first
restart must be the control (unperturbed) run, the 0 ensemble member. 
In order to create a good initial ensemble you can run an ensemble of
simulations with different forcings and/or boundary conditions and save the
restart at the first analysis step. The ensemble must be centered
(mean ~ control).

----------
Observation files
----------
1)
Sea level timeseries with time and value:
string-time1 value1
string-time2 value2 
...

For each timeseries file a info file is needed, with the same name added of an
extension '.info'. This file must contain in 1 row: x y z std
x, y, z = Coordinate of the observation, in the same reference system of the bas file. 
std = standard deviation (estimated error) of the observations

2)
Fem file with a surface current field. Bad values should be flagged with a -999.
As for the sea level timeseries, an info file is needed, containing a value
for the standard deviation.


Parameters of the assimilation
===================
See the file mod_para.F90 to set some more assimilation parameters.


Utilities
===================

shyfem_ens.sh:
Executes normal shyfem runs in parallel by using an ensemble of str files.

merge_ens.sh:
Merges ext or shy files produced during the analysis period
(i.e., anXXXXX_enYYYYY.ZZZ) in nrens files.
Timeseries are extracted in text files, with both the background and
the analysis values at the analysis times. Shy files are merged keeping
the analysis fields at the analysis times.
Anyway, it's better to use the rst files and then use rst2shy.

split_ext.sh:
Splits an ensemble of ext files with a common basename.

make_ens_wind:
Makes an ensemble from a deterministic wind. FEM file format. Works also for HFR radar fem files
and can be used also for the boundary condition with some adaptations.

make_eof_wind:
The same of the previous one, but using a EOF analysis of the wind and varying
the PCs.

enKF2enKS:
Makes the Kalman Smoother analysis after the Kalman Filter run.
