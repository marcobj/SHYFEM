	- nr of ens members;
	- name of the str-file of the base simulation;
	- basename of the rst-files;
	- name of a file with a observation list.
- Have n rst-file at the time of the first observation
- Make a str file, like those used to make the rst-files, from that time
- Make the obs list file with, in each row: time(sec) filename
- Make the obs-files listed in the list
