Files:
enKF.sh : Script to run enKF in parallel mode.
enKF_serial.sh : Script to run enKF in serial mode (Not parallel!).
enKF_analysis : Fortran executable called from enKF.sh. Do not execute it
alone.

HOW TO:

# Runs the Ensemble Kalman Filter analysis with enKF.sh. It needs a configuration file with 
# these inputs:
# - name of the bas file with extension;
# - skel-file for the str (it is possible to give a list of nens skel-files, using a standard name "skel_list.txt"); 
# - name of the list of the restart files. This determines the n of ens members;
# - name of the list of the observation files, containing rows like: time obs_file.
#
# You must prepare the restart files to be read at the initial time
# and the observation files, one at each time.
#
# Observations (see read_obs):
# The file of observations must be written in ascii format, separated by
# spaces.
# format:
# n_of_rows
# time obs_type(5 chars) x y z value stand_dev
# time obs_type(5 chars) x y z value stand_dev
# ...

# NOTES
In order to run the enKF.sh script you need a small GNU program, named "parallel".
Installation with Debian from root:
apt-get update && apt-get install parallel
Installation with Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install parallel
