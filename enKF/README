Files:
enKF.sh : Script to run enKF
enKF_analysis : Fortran executable called from enKF.sh

#################
HOW TO:

In order to run the EnKf you need:

- N restart files containing N sea background states;

- a set of observations (e.g., sea level, current, temperature, salinity);

- To compile a configuration file "analysis.info".


###
analysis.info

  read(20,*) sdate      ! date at time 0
  read(20,*) stime      ! time at time 0
  read(20,*) tobs       ! time in sec from time 0
  read(20,*) nens       ! number of ens members
  read(20,*) basfile    ! name of bas file (no extension)
  read(20,*) rstfile    ! name of restart files. No extension, just basename,
                        ! then the file must finish with "_enDDD.rst" with DDD 
                        ! three digits denoting the n of ens member.
  read(20,*) obsfile    ! name of obs file


- run ./run_enKF.sh


Format timeseries:
n_rows x y z st_dev_measurements
time1 value1
time2 value2
...


Notes:
analysis_ev.F90 is a modification of the original analysis.F90 in the Evensen_s_code/
folder.
