Programs
===================

- enKF.sh : main script to execute the assimilation;
- shyfem_ens.sh : run many shyfem simulations using different str files with a
  common basename;
- split_exts.sh : split many ext files with a common basename;
- merge_ens.sh : post-process ext and shy files in analysis, merging them;
- mean_std_ts.sh : compute mean and std timeseries of an ensemble of
  timeseries with a common basename;
- perturbeBC : makes an ensemble of perturbed boundary conditions (lateral,
  surface, fem-files, timeseries);
- make_eof_ens_meteo : makes an ensemble of perturbed winds with PCA (to
  check);
- make_antime_list : make the antime_list.txt. Works only with timeseries.
- enKF2enKS : Kalman Smoother from the output of Kalman Filter. Do not use
  with localisation.


Before running the code
===================

Install all the packages needed to compile SHYFEM, compile it and then
install also the following software:
- parallel;
- liblapack-dev;
- libfftw3-dev.


Running the code
===================

Some files must be prepared before running enKF.sh:

----------
ens_list.txt
----------
List of skel (to make the str) and restart initial files. Use the same name
for the restart file in case of just one initial state and the generation 
of the initial ensemble. For example:

medit_73830_S6_000.skel restart_000.rst
medit_73830_S6_001.skel restart_001.rst
medit_73830_S6_002.skel restart_002.rst
...

or 

medit_73830_S6_000.skel restart_000.rst
medit_73830_S6_001.skel restart_000.rst
medit_73830_S6_002.skel restart_000.rst
...

----------
obs_list.txt
----------
A list of observation files containing in each line:
- a flag of the type of observation;
- the name of the file.

example:

0DLEV Ancona_obs_ass.dat
0DLEV Bari_obs_ass.dat
0DLEV Cagliari_obs_ass.dat
0DLEV Catania_obs_ass.dat
...

Possible flag for the observations are:
- 0DLEV : sea level timeseries;
- 0DTEM : surface temperature timeseries;
- 0DSAL : surface salinity timeseries;
- 2DVEL : FEM-file with 2D surface current fields (e.g., HFR radar).

----------
antime_list.txt
----------
This file has a record of two rows. The first row contains the time in SHYFEM
format and the number of observation files (length of obs_list.txt). The
second row has a 0-1 mask with the obs files used in the current time step.
The following rows have the same format for the following analysis steps, in
ascending order.
This speed-up the program in case of many files, use make_antime_list to
create this file. If you don't want to use this option, prescribe a mask with
only 1 values at each timestep.

----------
lbound.dat (optional)
----------
This file is recommended and changes the analysis solution near the
boundaries. Full background at the boundary nodes, full analysis at a
determinate distance from the nodes (G-C function).
Put the n. of nodes in the first row, then each row has the id of the node and a
radius.

----------
mod_err.info (optional - experimental, never used)
----------
Set mode_an = 1 in mod_para.F90 to activate the model errors.
This file is used to set the red noise parameters to propagate the model error,
by using an augmented state.
Warning!!! The routine make_2Dpert gives a segmentation fault.

mod_err.info must contain a row with:

  - nx ny fmult theta rerror dt tau

  where:
  - nx,ny are the dimension of the grid of the pseudo random fields
  - fmult is the mult factor to create a supersample from the initial ensemble
  - theta is the rotation of the pseudo random fields (0 East, anticlockwise)
  - rerror is the error relative to each value of the model variables. Use a
    small one. At the moment just the water levels have errors.
  - dt is the time between two observation steps (assumes regular intervals)
  - tau is the e-folding time of the red noise in the model error

----------
skel files
----------
These are files used to make the str files of the ensemble members during all
the steps of the data assimilation. They should have the same settings of the
restart files.
It is extremely important that you write exactly the following linee:

- In the section $title the second line must contain the string: NAMESIM

- In the section $para the following strings must be copied exectly:
  itanf = 'ITANF'
  itend = 'ITEND'
  itrst = 'ITANF'
  idtrst = IDTRST	(no quotation marks)

- In the section $name the following string must be copied exectly:
  restrt = 'RESTRT'

If you want to save the results during the analysis add the following strings
in $para:

  itrst = 'ITANF'
  itout = 'ITANF'
  itext = 'ITANF'
  itcon = 'ITANF'
  itmflx = 'ITANF'

You can also use the SHYFEM program rst2shy to obtain shy files from the
restarts.

----------
Initial restart files
----------
They must have one record at the time of the first analysis step. The first
restart must be the control (unperturbed) run, the 0 ensemble member. 
In order to create a good initial ensemble you can run an ensemble of
simulations with different forcings and/or boundary conditions and save the
restart at the first analysis step. The ensemble must be centered
(mean ~ control).

----------
Observation files
----------
1)
Sea level timeseries with time and value:
string-time1 value1
string-time2 value2 
...

2)
Fem file with a surface current field. Bad values should be flagged with a -999.

----------
Info observation files
----------
For each observation file you need a file with some information about the
observation. The filename must be [obsfile.info] (add the extention .info to the 
obsfile).
This file must contain in one row five numbers: x y z std rho_loc
x, y, z = Coordinates of the observation, using the same coordinate system of the basin
std = standard deviation (estimated error) of the observation
rho_loc = radius for the local analysis (not used if isloc = 0 in
mod_para.F90).

Parameters of the assimilation
===================

See the file mod_para.F90 to set some assimilation parameters, like the
method of data assimilation, the use of the local analysis and more.
