To run it:
- Have an initial simulation

- Prepare the file asspar.txt with:
assdir     ! working dir
nrens            ! nr ens member
tt_anf           ! initial time
tt_end           ! final time
tt_eanf          ! time first ens creation
tt_eend          ! last time with ensemble
tt_oanf          ! time first observation
tt_oend          ! time last observation

- Prepare a list of obs files, in bin/ named 
	obs_list.txt
  with the following lines:
  obs_type  obs_file
  

- run ./run_enKF.sh


Format timeseries:
n_rows x y z st_dev_measurements
time1 value1
time2 value2
...
