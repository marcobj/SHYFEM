The square root algorithms in Evensen (2004) does
not in their standard form support the EnKS analysis
written as
   A=A prod(X_i)
as discussed in Evensen (2003)

A minor rewrite allows for the same smoother analysis
(see appendix B of Evensen, 2004).

Routines analysis4c.F90, analysis5c.F90 and analysis6c.F90,
includes this rewrite.
